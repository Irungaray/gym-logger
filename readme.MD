# Gym Logger

CLI interface to track your progress on the gym. It generates a file with the logs and (if you want) pushes it to GitHub so you can have it synced on all devices.

**Usage:**
CURL or WGET the install script. It will download *gym-logger.sh* to ~/.bin and create an alias for both **zsh** and **bash**.

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Irungaray/gym-logger/main/install.sh | bash

OR

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Irungaray/gym-logger/main/install.sh | bash

Once installed, you will have the "glog" alias to run the program. Once there, is pretty straight forward.

PS: Need to be logged on git in order to push.
